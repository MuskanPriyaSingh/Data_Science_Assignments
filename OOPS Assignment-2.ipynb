Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behavior relevant to the problem domain, while ignoring or abstracting away the less essential details. In Python, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract base classes(ABCs) and abstract methods provided by the 'abc' module.\n",
