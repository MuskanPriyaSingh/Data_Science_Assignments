Example: If a dataset of test scores has values from 60 to 95, the range is 95 - 60 = 35. This shows the spread between the highest and lowest scores.\n",

It gives a measure of how spread out the data points are, with larger variances indicating more spread. Example: If the test scores are clustered closely around the mean, the variance will be low. If they are widely scattered, the variance will be high.\n",

    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is expressed in the same units as the data, making it easier to interpret. It provides a clear measure of how much individual data points typically differ from the mean.

    "\n",
    "Answer:- Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation) in a dataset. Here's a breakdown of their effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: Outliers can skew the mean (average) of a dataset. Since the mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values, extreme outliers can disproportionately affect this measure. For example, if you have the following data points: 2, 3, 4, 5, 100, the mean is (2+3+4+5+100)/5= 22.8. The outlier (100) significantly raises the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median, which is the middle value when data is ordered, is less affected by outliers compared to the mean. For the same data points (2, 3, 4, 5, 100), the median is 4. In this case, the median remains relatively stable despite the presence of the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode, which is the most frequently occurring value, may not be affected much by outliers unless the outlier itself occurs with high frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Range: The range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) is directly affected by outliers. In the example data (2, 3, 4, 5, 100), the range is 100-2=98, which is significantly increased by the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Variance and Standard Deviation: Both variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data points around the mean. Outliers can inflate these measures because they increase the squared deviations from the mean. For instance, the variance and standard deviation will be much higher in the dataset including the outlier (2, 3, 4, 5, 100) compared to a dataset without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, outliers can distort the mean and measures of dispersion, making them less representative of the typical values in the dataset. The median is generally more robust to outliers and provides a better measure of central tendency in such cases.\n",
