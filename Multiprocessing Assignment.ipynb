    "'''Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to create and run multiple processes concurrently. A process is an independent program that runs in its own memory space and has its own resources, such as variables and files. Unlike multithreading, multiprocessing allows parallel execution of multiple processes, and each process runs independently, with its own Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
    "It is useful for:-\n",
    "1. Parallelism: Multiprocessing enables the execution of multiple processes in parallel, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "2. Separate Memory Space: Each process has its own memory space, which reduces the likelihood of data corruption due to shared data.\n",
    "3. Improved Performance: For computationally intensive tasks, multiprocessing can significantly improve performance by distributing the workload across multiple processes. \n",
    "4. Fault Isolation: Since each process runs independently, a failure or crash in one process does not affect others. This helps with fault isolation and makes the overall program more robust.\n",
    "5. Avoidance of Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In Python, the GIL limits the execution of multiple threads in a single process. Multiprocessing allows bypassing the GIL by running multiple processes, each with its own interpreter and GIL.\n",
    "6. Scalability: Multiprocessing is scalable, making it suitable for large-scale parallel processing tasks. \n",

Here are some of the main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
