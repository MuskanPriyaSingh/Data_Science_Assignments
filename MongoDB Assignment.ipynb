    "#Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Answer:- MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database system that uses a document-oriented data model. Instead of storing data in tables and rows like a traditional relational database (SQL), MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it particularly well-suited for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that diverges from the traditional relational database model. Unlike relational databases, which store data in structured tables with predefined schemas and support SQL for querying and manipulating data, non-relational databases utilize various data models and storage mechanisms to provide flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages for handling diverse types of data and high volumes of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred in scenarios where flexibility, scalability, high availability, and real-time analytics are crucial requirements for the application.\n",

    "1. Document-Oriented Storage: Stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema Flexibility: Dynamic schema allows for easy data modeling and schema evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Language: Supports a rich query language similar to JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing: Offers various types of indexes for improving query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Aggregation Framework: Allows for complex data processing and analysis within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Replication: Provides automatic data replication through replica sets for high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Sharding: Horizontally scales across multiple servers for handling large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. High Availability: Ensures continuous operation with features like replica sets and automatic failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Security: Offers authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing features for data protection.\n",
